First we need to understand XOR operation

ðŸ‘‰XOR operations:
0+0 = 0
1+1 = 0
1+0 = 1
0+1 = 1

Let's perform some binary XOR operation from the input above:
1 => 0001
0 => 0000
res = 0001 (As per the XOR operation, we got the results as 0001, which is "1")âœ…

for, 0 XOR 2 = 2âœ…

then 2 XOR 1 will be,
2 => 0010
1 => 0001
res = 0011 ( 3 )âœ…

This is how we got the output as [1, 2, 3] âœ…

var decode = function(encoded, first) {
    let arr = [encoded.length +1]
     arr[0]= first
    for(let i=0;i< encoded.length ;i++){
        arr[i+1] = encoded[i] ^ arr[i]
    }
    return arr;
};
