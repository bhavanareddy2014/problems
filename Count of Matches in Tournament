Count of Matches in Tournament

If the current number of teams is even, each team gets paired with another team. A total of n / 2 matches are played, and n / 2 teams advance to the next round.
If the current number of teams is odd, one team randomly advances in the tournament, and the rest gets paired. A total of (n - 1) / 2 matches are played, and (n - 1) / 2 + 1 teams advance to the next round.
Return the number of matches played in the tournament until a winner is decided.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 7
Output: 6
Explanation: Details of the tournament: 
- 1st Round: Teams = 7, Matches = 3, and 4 teams advance.
- 2nd Round: Teams = 4, Matches = 2, and 2 teams advance.
- 3rd Round: Teams = 2, Matches = 1, and 1 team is declared the winner.
Total number of matches = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6.
Example 2:

Input: n = 14
Output: 13
Explanation: Details of the tournament:
- 1st Round: Teams = 14, Matches = 7, and 7 teams advance.
- 2nd Round: Teams = 7, Matches = 3, and 4 teams advance.
- 3rd Round: Teams = 4, Matches = 2, and 2 teams advance.
- 4th Round: Teams = 2, Matches = 1, and 1 team is declared the winner.
Total number of matches = 7 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 13.

var numberOfMatches = function(n) {

    let sum = 0;

    while (Math.floor(teams/2) > 0) {
        // conditions following what the problem says
		if (teams % 2 === 0) {
		    // adding the sum before changing the teams will work
            sum = sum + teams / 2
            teams = teams / 2
        } else {
		    // change what to add if teams is odd
            sum = sum + (teams - 1) / 2
            teams = (teams - 1) / 2 + 1
        }
    } return sum;
