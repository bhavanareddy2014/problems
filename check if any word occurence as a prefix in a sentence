Given a sentence that consists of some words separated by a single space, and a searchWord, check if searchWord is a prefix of any word in sentence.

Return the index of the word in sentence (1-indexed) where searchWord is a prefix of this word. If searchWord is a prefix of more than one word, return the index of the first word (minimum index). If there is no such word return -1.

A prefix of a string s is any leading contiguous substring of s.

 

Example 1:

Input: sentence = "i love eating burger", searchWord = "burg"
Output: 4
Explanation: "burg" is prefix of "burger" which is the 4th word in the sentence.

without testcases:

const isPrefixOfWord = (sentence, searchWord) => {
  const words = sentence.split(' ');
  for (let i = 0; i < words.length; ++i) {
    if (words[i].startsWith(searchWord)) return i + 1;
  }
  return -1;
};


not completed all testcases

var isPrefixOfWord = function(sentence, searchWord) {
    sentence = sentence.split(" ")
    let count =0
    for(let i=0 ;i < sentence.length;i++){
      if(sentence[i].slice(0,searchWord.length) == searchWord){
         count =  sentence.indexOf(sentence[i]) + 1
      }
  }
  if(count === 0) {
      return  -1;
  }
  return count;
};
