Reverse Prefix of Word


Example 1:

Input: word = "abcdefd", ch = "d"
Output: "dcbaefd"
Explanation: The first occurrence of "d" is at index 3. 
Reverse the part of word from 0 to 3 (inclusive), the resulting string is "dcbaefd".
Example 2:

Input: word = "xyxzxe", ch = "z"
Output: "zxyxxe"
Explanation: The first and only occurrence of "z" is at index 3.
Reverse the part of word from 0 to 3 (inclusive), the resulting string is "zxyxxe".
Example 3:

Input: word = "abcd", ch = "z"
Output: "abcd"
Explanation: "z" does not exist in word.
You should not do any reverse operation, the resulting string is "abcd".


var reversePrefix = function(word, ch) {
    let n = word.indexOf(ch)
    let res = ""
    let res1= ""
    for(let i=n ;i>=0;i--){
         res += word[i]
    }
    for(let j=n+1;j<word.length;j++){
        res1 +=word[j]
    }
    return res+res1;
};
