You are given a 0-indexed array of string words and two integers left and right.

A string is called a vowel string if it starts with a vowel character and ends with a vowel character where vowel characters are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'.

Return the number of vowel strings words[i] where i belongs to the inclusive range [left, right].

 

Example 1:

Input: words = ["are","amy","u"], left = 0, right = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: 
- "are" is a vowel string because it starts with 'a' and ends with 'e'.
- "amy" is not a vowel string because it does not end with a vowel.
- "u" is a vowel string because it starts with 'u' and ends with 'u'.
The number of vowel strings in the mentioned range is 2.


var vowelStrings = function(words, left, right) {
    let c=0;
    for(let i=left;i<= right;i++){
        if((words[i][0] ==  "a" || words[i][0] == "e" || words[i][0] == "i" || words[i][0] == "o" || words[i][0] == 'u' ) &&(
        words[i][words[i].length -1] == "a" || words[i][words[i].length -1] == "e" || words[i][words[i].length-1] == "i" || words[i][words[i].length -1] == "o" || words[i][words[i].length-1] == 'u')){
             c++ 
    }
    }
    return c;
};
