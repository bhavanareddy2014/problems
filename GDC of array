Find Greatest Common Divisor of Array


Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,5,6,9,10] 
Output: 2
Explanation:
The smallest number in nums is 2.
The largest number in nums is 10.
The greatest common divisor of 2 and 10 is 2.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [7,5,6,8,3]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The smallest number in nums is 3.
The largest number in nums is 8.
The greatest common divisor of 3 and 8 is 1.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3]
Output: 3
Explanation:
The smallest number in nums is 3.
The largest number in nums is 3.
The greatest common divisor of 3 and 3 is 3.







var findGCD = function(nums) {
    let a =  Math.max(...nums)
    let b = Math.min(...nums)
    let divisor;
    for(let i=1;i<=a && i<=b ;i++){
        if(a % i == 0 && b % i ==0){
            divisor = i
        }
    }
    return divisor
};
