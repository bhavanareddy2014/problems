Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4



function singleNumber(nums) {
  let num = 0;
  for (let n of nums) {
    num ^= n;
  }
  return num;
}
