You are given a string s and an integer array indices of the same length. The string s will be shuffled such that the character at the ith position moves to indices[i] in the shuffled string.

Return the shuffled string.

 

Example 1:



solution
var restoreString = function(s, indices) {
let newArr = [];
for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
newArr[indices[i]] = s[i];
}
return newArr.join("");
};
