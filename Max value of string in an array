Maximum Value of a String in an Array


Example 1:

Input: strs = ["alic3","bob","3","4","00000"]
Output: 5
Explanation: 
- "alic3" consists of both letters and digits, so its value is its length, i.e. 5.
- "bob" consists only of letters, so its value is also its length, i.e. 3.
- "3" consists only of digits, so its value is its numeric equivalent, i.e. 3.
- "4" also consists only of digits, so its value is 4.
- "00000" consists only of digits, so its value is 0.
Hence, the maximum value is 5, of "alic3".
Example 2:

Input: strs = ["1","01","001","0001"]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
Each string in the array has value 1. Hence, we return 1.



var maximumValue = function(strs) {
    let temp = []
    for(let i=0;i<strs.length;i++){
        if(/^\d+$/.test(strs[i])){
            temp.push(Number(strs[i]))
        }
        else {
            let a = strs[i].length
        temp.push(a)
        }   
    }
    let res =  Math.max(...temp)
    return res
};
