Third Maximum Number

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The first distinct maximum is 3.
The second distinct maximum is 2.
The third distinct maximum is 1.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2]
Output: 2
Explanation:
The first distinct maximum is 2.
The second distinct maximum is 1.
The third distinct maximum does not exist, so the maximum (2) is returned instead.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [2,2,3,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The first distinct maximum is 3.
The second distinct maximum is 2 (both 2's are counted together since they have the same value).
The third distinct maximum is 1.

var thirdMax = function(nums) {
    const arr = [...new Set(nums)];

    arr.sort((a, b) => a - b);

    if (arr.length >= 3) {
        return arr[arr.length - 3];
    } else {
        return arr[arr.length - 1];
    }
};
