Number of common factors

Example 1:

Input: a = 12, b = 6
Output: 4
Explanation: The common factors of 12 and 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6.
Example 2:

Input: a = 25, b = 30
Output: 2
Explanation: The common factors of 25 and 30 are 1, 5.


var commonFactors = function(a, b) {
    let count = 0
    for(let i=0;i<=Math.min(a,b) ;i++){
        if(a%i == 0  && b % i == 0){
            count++
        }
    }
    return count;
};
