You are given an array of strings names, and an array heights that consists of distinct positive integers. Both arrays are of length n.

For each index i, names[i] and heights[i] denote the name and height of the ith person.

Return names sorted in descending order by the people's heights.

 

Example 1:

Input: names = ["Mary","John","Emma"], heights = [180,165,170]
Output: ["Mary","Emma","John"]
Explanation: Mary is the tallest, followed by Emma and John


var sortPeople = function(names, heights) {
    let finalArray = []
    for(let i=0;i<names.length;i++){
        finalArray.push([names[i],heights[i]])
    }
    return finalArray.sort((a,b)=>b[1]-a[1]).map((a)=>a[0]);
    
};
