Keep Multiplying Found Values by Two

Example 1:

Input: nums = [5,3,6,1,12], original = 3
Output: 24
Explanation: 
- 3 is found in nums. 3 is multiplied by 2 to obtain 6.
- 6 is found in nums. 6 is multiplied by 2 to obtain 12.
- 12 is found in nums. 12 is multiplied by 2 to obtain 24.
- 24 is not found in nums. Thus, 24 is returned.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,7,9], original = 4
Output: 4
Explanation:
- 4 is not found in nums. Thus, 4 is returned.

var findFinalValue = function(nums, original) {
    while(nums.includes(original)){
        original = original * 2 ;
    }
    return original;
}
